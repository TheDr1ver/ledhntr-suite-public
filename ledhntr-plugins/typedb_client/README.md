# DISCLAIMER

This TypeDB Client Wrapper was originally written for an older version
(TypeDB v2.18.1), but have retro-fitted it to work with the latest version
(2.28.0)... I hope.

As a result, there are probably some functions in here that don't work exactly
the way they once did. I've tried testing for all the basic scenarios, but I'm
sure there are some things I missed.

Additionally, it sounds like with the move to v3.0 even MORE things are going
to change and they're going to do away with the Concept API entirely, so I'm
probably not going to sweat too much about this particular version.

I'm basically just publicly publishing this in the event it might help someone
else with troubleshooting/implementing their own version of the current Python
driver.

YMMV - You've been warned :)
