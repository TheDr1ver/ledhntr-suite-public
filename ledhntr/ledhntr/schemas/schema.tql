    #### Relations
    ############################

    # hntr-relation is a meta-relation that serves as a template for almost
    # all other relations. Basically everything that sub's hntr-relation will
    # inherit the qualities defined here.
    # ############
    # * NOTE - Any Relation or Entity that isn't a meta-relation NEEDS to have a
    # * @key attribute associated with it. If an entity or relation doesn't have
    # * a single, natural key field  (e.g. whois/geoloc/etc), then it should use
    # * the 'comboid' Attribute as its key. The 'comboid' attribute is generated
    # * by sorting all non-meta attributes, converting them to a string format,
    # * and sha256-hashing the results.
    # & ...
    # & I'm gonna try and avoid comboid with the attachment relation and see if
    # & that works out.
